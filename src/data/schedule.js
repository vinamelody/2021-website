At some point, we want to start using SwiftUI when building our apps. Since SwiftUI is a relatively new framework, we might come across some constraints when using it for fully-fledged apps. This talk is about using SwiftUI to build and ship complex apps for multiple Apple platforms. We will go through how we can structure our projects when building apps for multiple platforms, how to combine SwiftUI with AppKit and UIKit, how to work around some limitations, and how to put the new framework to its best use.",

We implement a Codable model and it fits the API just perfectly, and the magical automatic implementation provided by Swift just works and there’s so little code you have to write.
