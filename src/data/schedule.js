This talk is about using SwiftUI to build and ship complex apps for multiple Apple platforms. We will go through how we can structure our projects when building apps for multiple platforms, how to combine SwiftUI with AppKit and UIKit, how to work around some limitations, and how to put the new framework to its best use.",
